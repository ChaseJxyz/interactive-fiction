platypus 2025
An Interactive Fiction by Chase Anderson
Release 1 / Serial number 250614 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Apartment
  You are awoken by the shriek of your alarm. Your paw slaps around for the snooze button, condensation collecting on the webbings. Finally, you find your mark, and the whistling steam quiets.

You&apos;re tempted to fall back asleep, but you recall the tenuous status you have with your boss. So, you pull yourself out of your bed to view your single-room home once more. It isn&apos;t much, but you don&apos;t want to lose it.

 There&apos;s a corner for your bathroom-slash-kitchen, complete with a washing basin atop a safe. There&apos;s also a brick fireplace, a small bookshelf, your bed, and your alarm clock. There is an additional steam hookup, currently unused. And, of course, the door that leads you OUTSIDE your apartment.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

 Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent. If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building.

You turn around and go back to your previous position.

You make a note to tell your vulture friend later, and then turn around and return to the street.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded. You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items).

Network
  You&apos;ll probably never get used to the feeling of tumbling inside-out that always happens whenever you connect to the network...with your mind, because you&apos;re so amazing that you don&apos;t need items.

 The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network.

Office
  You&apos;re able to punch in just in time; your boss won&apos;t be able to accuse you of being late this time!

 As you were never taught how to speak, you do not run into any creatures on the way to your closet. Lucky you!

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items.). You can also leave the office by going NORTH.

Apartment
  There&apos;s a corner for your bathroom-slash-kitchen, complete with a washing basin atop a safe. There&apos;s also a brick fireplace, a small bookshelf, your bed, and your alarm clock. There is an additional steam hookup, currently unused. And, of course, the door that leads you OUTSIDE your apartment.

  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A young bat stumbles on the sidewalk, calling out for buyers for the evening edition of the paper. He&apos;s emoting with his wings, which draws attention, but gives everyone reason to avoid him to stay out of range.

You decide to do the same.

 Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent. If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded. You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items).

Office
  You&apos;re able to punch in just in time; your boss won&apos;t be able to accuse you of being late this time!

 As you were never taught how to speak, you do not run into any creatures on the way to your closet. Lucky you!

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items.). You can also leave the office by going NORTH.

  You&apos;ll probably never get used to the feeling of tumbling inside-out that always happens whenever you connect to the network...with your mind, because you&apos;re so amazing that you don&apos;t need items.

 The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

Office
  You&apos;re able to punch in just in time; your boss won&apos;t be able to accuse you of being late this time!

 As you were never taught how to speak, you do not run into any creatures on the way to your closet. Lucky you!

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items.). You can also leave the office by going NORTH.

  You&apos;ll probably never get used to the feeling of tumbling inside-out that always happens whenever you connect to the network...with your mind, because you&apos;re so amazing that you don&apos;t need items.

 The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network. 

A red pool of energy quietly swirls.

A blue pool of energy gives off a faint buzz along your beak.

A green pool of energy is constantly churning and can easily pull you under if you don&apos;t approach it with care.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. 

You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded on the SOUTH wall.

  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

Apartment
  There&apos;s a corner for your bathroom-slash-kitchen, complete with a washing basin atop a safe. There&apos;s also a brick fireplace, a small bookshelf, your bed, and your alarm clock. There is an additional steam hookup, currently unused. And, of course, the door that leads you OUTSIDE your apartment.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

 Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent. If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded. You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items).

Network
  You&apos;ll probably never get used to the feeling of tumbling inside-out that always happens whenever you connect to the network...with your mind, because you&apos;re so amazing that you don&apos;t need items.

 The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network.

Office
  You&apos;re able to punch in just in time; your boss won&apos;t be able to accuse you of being late this time!

 As you were never taught how to speak, you do not run into any creatures on the way to your closet. Lucky you!

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items.). You can also leave the office by going NORTH.

Some engineer surely lost many nights worth of sleep to design a connection that only allows the emission of steam when a authorized connecting cable is used. Granted, only the utility company has the tools to add or remove the connections, as well as hold the patent for the cables. You understand the issue with this, but you&apos;re also not interested in designing your own tools and risking steam burns.

Your neighbors aren&apos;t super appreciative of this modern convenience, though. Probably because they keep entirely different hours than you do.  

Alarm clock is currently switched off.

Some engineer surely lost many nights worth of sleep to design a connection that only allows the emission of steam when a authorized connecting cable is used. Granted, only the utility company has the tools to add or remove the connections, as well as hold the patent for the cables. You understand the issue with this, but you&apos;re also not interested in designing your own tools and risking steam burns.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A young bat stumbles on the sidewalk, calling out for buyers for the evening edition of the paper. He&apos;s emoting with his wings, which draws attention, but gives everyone reason to avoid him to stay out of range.

You decide to do the same.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded. You&apos;re so amazing that you can go INSIDE the leyline network without an item (as you have yet to learn how to use items).

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A young bat stumbles on the sidewalk, calling out for buyers for the evening edition of the paper. He&apos;s emoting with his wings, which draws attention, but gives everyone reason to avoid him to stay out of range.

You decide to do the same.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;G&apos;day,&quot; says the clerk behind the counter, with a big smile.

A couple patrons glance at you, likely wondering if the weasel was making fun of you. But you&apos;ve been going here for years, so you chalk it up to fitting the &quot;Australis&quot; theme than anything else.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. 

You can&apos;t help but notice the leyline jack is left unguarded.

  You&apos;re able to punch in just in time; your boss won&apos;t be able to accuse you of being late this time!

 As you were never taught how to speak, you do not run into any creatures on the way to your closet. Lucky you!

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

When you&apos;re ready to begin, you can go INSIDE the network. You can also leave the office by going NORTH. 

The leyline connector is awaiting the start of your shift.

The Network
  You&apos;ll probably never get used to the feeling of tumbling inside-out that always happens whenever you connect to the network...with your mind, because you&apos;re so amazing that you don&apos;t need items.

 The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network. 

 A leyline jack is available.

A red pool of energy quietly swirls.

A blue pool of energy gives off a faint buzz along your beak.

A green pool of energy is constantly churning and can easily pull you under if you don&apos;t approach it with care.

Unlike other animals, you don&apos;t mind the dark, enclosed space of the networking closet. The softly-glowing cords of the leyline network create glittering afterimages if you look at one spot for too long.

You have tasks that are your duty to perform, but you aren&apos;t capable of remembering what they are.

When you&apos;re ready to begin, you can go INSIDE the network. You can also leave the office by going NORTH.

Cafe
 The bell above the door tinkles as you step inside.

 &quot;Hey,&quot; the clerk says. &quot;You feeling okay? If you need a glass of water or something, you can just ask.&quot;

You still don&apos;t answer her, which she acknowledges by glancing away nervously. She busies herself with something behind the counter you can&apos;t see.

 While you were indeed hungry, you didn&apos;t have the time to kick your webs up and relax, so you better get going if you planned on not angering your boss.

The cafe has several patrons sitting at different tables, a clerk standing behind the counter, and the door to leave in the EAST. 

 A leyline jack is available.

The Network
  The leyline network is an abstract space, colors and intent swirling in place until a current of energy might rush by and take it from one place to another.

You&apos;re one of the lucky few that is able to visualize this space...but not lucky enough to have the aptitude to actually create the spells yourself. Instead, you&apos;re nothing more than a glorified guard, poking at suspicious-looking tidepools to find anything that might not supposed to be there.

There are various areas of color you could inspect, but you don&apos;t seem to recall how to do that. The only action you&apos;re able to leave is by going OUTSIDE of the network. 

 A leyline jack is available.

A red pool of energy quietly swirls.

A blue pool of energy gives off a faint buzz along your beak.

A green pool of energy is constantly churning and can easily pull you under if you don&apos;t approach it with care.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. You can also go back INSIDE your apartment. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

  There&apos;s a corner for your bathroom-slash-kitchen, complete with a washing basin atop a safe. There&apos;s also a brick fireplace, a small bookshelf, your bed, and your alarm clock. There is an additional steam hookup, currently unused. And, of course, the door that leads you OUTSIDE your apartment.

Street
  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

  When you first saw the listing for an apartment on Telegraph Ave, you thought it was a wonderful idea. Night markets! Plays! All the bars a young platypus could ever want to visit!

That was before you got your night shift job. Now, all the activity is merely a reminder of all the things you are no longer able to do. Most of the other nocturnal animals in your city had chosen elsewhere to live, where most of the inhabitants were away at work and they could sleep in peace.

Telegraph was busy at all hours, which made finding sleep difficult.

  A tram stops and a stream of creatures jump off, scattering in each direction as they headed to their evening activities. You plan to jump on yourself, but it takes off before you have the chance.

It seems like you&apos;ll need to walk to work tonight.

 If you continue SOUTH, you&apos;ll reach your office building. 

Across the street to the WEST is the cafe you often frequent.

Apartment
  There&apos;s a corner for your bathroom-slash-kitchen, complete with a washing basin atop a safe. There&apos;s also a brick fireplace, a small bookshelf, your bed, and your alarm clock. There is an additional steam hookup, currently unused. And, of course, the door that leads you OUTSIDE your apartment.

But you&apos;re already in bed.
