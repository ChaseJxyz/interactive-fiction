    "But the bad seasons have grown more frequent, the reprieves more rare. When the first foal was born with a coat white as snow, eyes pale as the moon, it was seen as a portent of change. Even after it died a few days later, it had to be a sign.",
    "After the third foal in a row suffered the same fate, it was recognized the curse it was. Perhaps it was a kindness, with the thinning of the grass, the weakening of the river, the reddening of the sky. The world you once knew was dying an ignoble death.",
    "Still, your youngest daughter is due any day. She still holds hope that the world will turn green and new again. You look to the stars, lurking above the herd bedding down for the night. The seven familiar dapple of the great horse constellation is still there, despite everything.",

    "You snort and dance backwards to see a crow standing before you. 'Horse come to fox's wedding,' it says. 'But get gifts first. Seven good. Back morning, yes?' It flies off before you can ask what it means."
    "You awaken the next day to see the the crow impatiently staring at you. 'Seven stars, seven gifts,' it reminds you. It pokes the the thing it's standing on, hides and furs from different animals, scarred together into an unliving mass. 'Fox give gift back,' it adds.",
    "This is another portent, surely, and you hope it to be a good one. You tell the crow you'll accept the invitation and find the gifts for fox.",
